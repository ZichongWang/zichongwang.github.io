## About

Hi, I’m Zichong Wang (王子翀). I’m currently a senior in the School of Statistics at Renmin University of China. Starting Fall 2026, I will pursue my Ph.D. in the Department of Statistics and Data Science at Tsinghua University, advised by [Prof. Jianqiao Wang](https://jianqiao.me/). Previously, I was honored to be mentored by [Prof. Hongteng Xu](https://hongtengxu.github.io/) during my undergraduate years.

I'm now working on Virtual Cell, trying to understand how genetic perturbations affect cellular states. For potential collaboration, please feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:zichongwang@ruc.edu.cn">zichongwang@ruc.edu.cn</a>.

## Research Interest

I’m interested in the intersection of statistics, AI, and biology, with a focus on computational models of the central dogma that link genetic variation, transcriptional regulation, and protein function.
